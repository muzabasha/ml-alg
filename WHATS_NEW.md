# 🎉 What's New - LaTeX Math Rendering

## Latest Update: February 12, 2026

### ✨ New Feature: Beautiful Mathematical Equations

Your ML Learning Platform now displays mathematical equations beautifully using LaTeX!

---

## 🔍 What You'll See

### Before (Plain Text)
```
Cost Function: J(θ₀, θ₁) = (1/2m) × Σ(h(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾)²
```

### After (Beautiful LaTeX)
![Beautiful rendered equation with proper mathematical symbols, fractions, and formatting]

## 📍 Where to Find It

LaTeX equations appear in the **"Mathematical Formulation"** section of every algorithm:

1. Go to any algorithm page (e.g., Linear Regression)
2. Click on "Mathematical Formulation" in the sidebar
3. See beautiful equations with:
   - Greek letters (θ, α, β, σ)
   - Fractions and summations
   - Subscripts and superscripts
   - Professional mathematical formatting

---

## 🎨 Visual Design

Equations are displayed in:
- **Purple-themed boxes** with rounded corners
- **Bordered containers** for emphasis
- **Scrollable areas** for long equations
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices

## 📚 All 9 Algorithms Updated

Every algorithm now has LaTeX equations:

### Classical ML
1. ✅ Linear Regression - Cost function, gradient descent
2. ✅ Logistic Regression - Sigmoid, cross-entropy
3. ✅ KNN - Distance metrics
4. ✅ Decision Tree - Entropy, information gain
5. ✅ SVM - Hyperplane, margin optimization

### Deep Learning
6. ✅ ANN - Forward propagation, backpropagation
7. ✅ CNN - Convolution operation, pooling
8. ✅ RNN - Recurrent connections, LSTM gates
9. ✅ Transformer - Attention mechanism, multi-head attention

## 📖 Example Equations

### Linear Regression
```latex
h(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x
J(θ) = (1/2m) Σ(h(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾)²
```

### Neural Networks
```latex
z = Σwᵢxᵢ + b
a = max(0, z)  [ReLU]
```

### Transformers
```latex
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V
```
